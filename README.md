# syn-remote

The desktop, from somewhere else — over VNC, or as a video stream. A thin
wrapper over **wayvnc** and **sunshine**, plus the parts a wrapper has to add.

```bash
syn-remote on                # serve this desktop, now and at every login
syn-remote status            # what it is doing
syn-remote address           # how to reach it
syn-remote listen lan        # the network, rather than this machine only
syn-remote wakeable on       # let a magic packet wake this machine while it sleeps

syn-remote stream on         # …or stream it to Moonlight instead
syn-remote stream pair 1234  # accept the PIN a Moonlight client is showing
syn-remote stream status     # what it is serving, and to how many

syn-remote add desk 192.168.1.20 velle   # a machine to reach
syn-remote trust desk        # check its certificate, once, before the first connection
syn-remote connect desk      # open it — waking it first if it is asleep
syn-remote add tv 192.168.1.60 --stream  # …a Moonlight host, opened with Moonlight
syn-remote gui | tui         # the same list, in a window or in the terminal
```

## "Wayland cannot do remote desktop" does not apply here

All three reasons that is said are about other stacks. GNOME and KDE gate
capture behind a portal that asks a human per session. `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`
implements ScreenCast but **not** RemoteDesktop, so portal-based tools can watch
a wlroots desktop and cannot touch it. And nothing exists to connect to before
somebody logs in — which is true here too, and `syn-remote status` says so
rather than failing obscurely.

wayvnc captures through `zwlr_screencopy_manager_v1` and drives the seat through
`zwp_virtual_pointer_manager_v1` and `zwp_virtual_keyboard_manager_v1`. synui
implements all three for any native client, so no portal is involved and nothing
prompts.

## What the wrapper adds

**A blanked output cannot be captured at all.** Once the idle blank stage has
fired, screencopy answers *failed to copy output* — a viewer gets nothing, and
there is no frame to click on to get out of it. A connection turns the outputs
back on and holds a real idle inhibitor until the last viewer leaves.

**It binds to loopback.** A port on `0.0.0.0` is reachable by every device on
the network; `syn-remote listen lan` is the deliberate way to change that, and
says what it means at the time. Either way the connection carries TLS and a
password — wayvnc's `enable_auth` needs a certificate, a key and a password
together, so there is no password without encryption.

**The certificate is checked in front of a person.** wayvnc's certificate is
self-signed, so the first connection is trust-on-first-use: `syn-remote trust`
prints the fingerprint and waits for a yes. Until then the TLS session comes up
and is dropped with no error on the machine you are sitting at — the only trace
is *Client handshake timed out* in the server's journal, which reads like a
firewall and is not one.

**And a machine that is asleep answers nothing at all.** `syn-remote wakeable`
arms the wired card for a magic packet and reports what is armed **now** as well
as what will still be armed after a reboot — two different questions, and a
machine that is armed today and forgotten at the next boot reads as working
right up until the reboot nobody connects to it after. `syn-remote wake <name>`
sends the packet; `connect` sends one by itself when the machine it is opening
is not answering. ⚠ A magic packet is a broadcast, so the machine sending it has
to be on the same network as the machine being woken.

## Streaming, and the display it serves

VNC sends rectangles of pixels; a stream sends an encoded video frame, so the
GPU does the work and a desktop at 1440p120 is smooth where VNC is a slideshow.
sunshine's Wayland grabber binds `zwlr_export_dmabuf_manager_v1` and
`xdg_output`, both of which synui exports, so this needs no portal either. The
generated config pins `capture = wlr`: with capture left to autodetection
sunshine prefers X11 whenever `DISPLAY` is set, which on a desktop running
XWayland means a stream of XWayland windows and nothing else.

**A streaming host is on the network.** sunshine binds every interface and
announces itself over mDNS — there is no loopback-only mode, unlike the VNC
server above. Pairing is what stands in the way, and it is per client.

**By default the stream gets a display of its own.** synui grows a headless
output on demand — a real screen in every way except the cable — and the stream
serves that instead of a monitor. When a client connects, the display is resized
to exactly the resolution and frame rate that client asked for, and it goes away
when streaming stops.

```bash
syn-remote stream display virtual        # a display of its own (the default)
syn-remote stream display auto           # …or the screen that is on this desk
syn-remote stream mode 2560x1440@120     # what the virtual display starts at
syn-remote stream solo on                # the screens in this room go dark while
                                         # somebody is streaming
```

The idle blank stage never turns a virtual display off: a blanked output cannot
be captured, and there is nobody in front of this one to wake it.

## Requires

wayvnc, wlopm, gtk-vnc, openssl, python, sunshine, moonlight-qt. synui 0.1.0-610
or newer for the virtual display a stream is served on; without it, streaming
falls back to a real screen and says so. NetworkManager is optional and
load-bearing for one thing: without it the wake flag is set until the next
reboot only, and `wakeable` says so.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/velle999/syn-remote
cd syn-remote && makepkg -si
```

makepkg fetches the source for this PKGBUILD's exact version from this
repository's releases, so a clone can only ever build the source it was
written against. `.SRCINFO` lists what it needs.

## Where this comes from

Developed in [the SynapseOS monorepo](https://github.com/velle999/SYNAPSE),
in `syn-remote/`. **This repository is generated from it** — the PKGBUILD, a
generated `.SRCINFO` and this README — so issues and patches belong there.
